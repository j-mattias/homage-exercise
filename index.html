                <h1>Homer Jay Simpson</h1>
                <h2>Bumbling, lovable, lazy family man</h2>
                <p>
                    Homer Jay Simpson is the protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. He is voiced by
                    Dan Castellaneta and first appeared, along with the rest of the Simpsons, in The Tracey Ullman 
                    Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created by the cartoonist Matt Groening 
                    while he was waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called 
                    to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead created a new set 
                    of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for 
                    three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpsons received their own series on Fox, which 
                    debuted on December 17, 1989.

                    Homer is the nominal foreman of the paternally eponymous family. He and his wife Marge have three 
                    children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear 
                    Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is 
                    obese, balding, immature, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and fond of 
                    beer, junk food and television. However, he is fundamentally a good man and is staunchly 
                    protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban 
                    blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going 
                    to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President 
                    George H. W. Bush, and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a barbershop quartet.
